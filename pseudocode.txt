1. when on RYM, print "hello RYM"

what do we want to do?
 - increment counter when RYM is first opened

how?
  - keep track of open tabs?
  - when navigated to a page with root URL
    - check if another RYM tab is opened
      - if yes
        increment counter
      - else if no
        ignore

we probably want the background job to keep track of open tabs
- when navigated to rym page
  - background job keeps track of open tabs
  - listens to a new tab being opened
    - IF RYM && no RYM tabs open
      - increment counter

how to check open tabs?
  - get the tabs from storage
    - initialise with default value of empty array if not

do i need to keep track of all tabs? can't i just check if any RYM tabs open?
