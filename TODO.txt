START:

1. Build simple extension that detects when you visit RYM
2. Set up backend endpoint to receieve data (i.e. how many visits to RYM)
3. Use simple visualisation library to display very simple data
4. Design DB that could store everything in WISHLIST


LOOP OVER:
For each item on WISHLIST
  1. parse necessary DOM data
  2. store in DB
  3. Find simple ways to visualise


TESTING:
Claude suggestions:
1. Automated Browser Testing
  - Use tools like Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium to automate browser actions
  - Script scenarios like "visit RYM pages, click around, check ratings"
  - Verify that your extension correctly captures these scripted behaviors
2. Mock Pages
  - Create local HTML files that mimic RYM pages with known content
  - Test your DOM parsing against these static files
  - This lets you verify extraction logic works without hitting the actual site
3. Event Testing
  - Use Chrome's extension debugging tools to monitor events being fired
  - Create test pages that trigger specific behaviors (rating changes, etc.)
  - Verify events are captured correctly


WISHLIST:

1. Track RYM Usage
  - how many vists
  - how many tabs opened
  - what time you're on it
  - which artists (count each)
  - which albums (count each)
    - the year released
    - the primary genres
  - when you leave a rating and what the rating is
  - when you change a rating (from what to what)
  - which charts you look at the most

2. Analyse data
  - how many unique artists
  - how many unique albums
  - most visited artists
  - most visited albums
  - most popular years
  - most popular decades
  - most popular genres
  - how often you leave a rating
  - what your initial ratings

3. Display data
  - ???
